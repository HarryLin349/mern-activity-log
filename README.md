# Activity Log Web App

An activity log website I made that allows users to log activities to a global log where it can be shared with others.

The main features of this site include:

- Creating Users
- Logging Activities with a description and date
- Editing or deleting prior entries

## Database

I used MongoDB for Object Data Modeling to organise and store information in collections. 
I then stored server data in a cloud database via MongoDB Atlas, to be accessed through a custom API.

## React

I used React for this website because I wanted to develop a website through modular design using components.
This allowed me to cut down on repetitive code and allowed me to update and maintain the website much easier.

## How Do I Access the Website?

You can visit the completed website on Heroku, where it's been deployed!
https://desolate-beach-55953.herokuapp.com/

You can also run it after downloading the source code here.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
